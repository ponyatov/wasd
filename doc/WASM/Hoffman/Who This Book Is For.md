# Who This Book Is For

This book is for anyone who wants to build [[Web/application]]s. Whether you’ve had just a little bit of JavaScript exposure or whether you’re a seasoned professional with dozens of [[React]] and [[Redux]] applications under your belt, WebAssembly has the potential to change the way you build apps and the power of those applications in a way that few technologies before ever have.

Whether you consider yourself a [[frontend]], [[backend]], [[embedded/embedded]], or any other kind of developer — this book is for you. Compiling other languages to WebAssembly means you get to use familiar development life cycles and toolchains and build and test strongly-typed, powerful code.

Finally, if you think that there’s more to this WebAssembly thing than just web applications, then you’ll enjoy this book as well as we build [[WebAssembly interpreter in Rust]] and run them on [[Raspberry Pi]]s to control [[embedded/hardware]] via [[GPIO]]. WebAssembly holds a lot of promise for many different types of developers, including the promise of unifying back- and front-end coding experiences.
