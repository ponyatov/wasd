# Why [[Rust]]?

Rust is a systems language that compiles to native binaries on any number of operating systems and hardware architectures. It is 
- fast, 
- its binaries take up very little space and 
- have a small memory footprint, and is 
- designed from the ground up to avoid 
	- accidental mutation, 
	- null referencing, and 
	- data races.

In fact, the compiler will check your code and prevent you from making those mistakes.

But I chose Rust for this book for reasons beyond just the language syntax and its powerful compiler. What excited me about Rust was how quickly it embraced WebAssembly. While other languages right now can compile code to WebAssembly, the sheer number of libraries and tools available within the Rust community for WebAssembly is staggering. It is the enthusiasm, support, and rapid pace of advancement in the [Rust WebAssembly community](https://rustwasm.github.io/) that influenced my decision to use Rust for this book.
