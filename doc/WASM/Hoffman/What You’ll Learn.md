# What You’ll Learn

This book is divided up into three main parts:

1. Building a Foundation
	- As you build a foundation, you’ll learn the fundamentals and the core [[WASM/architecture]] of WebAssembly, including what it [[WASM/can]] and [[WASM/cannot]] do and how you can develop basic applications. By the time you reach the end of this section, you’ll be able to create a Checkers engine written entirely in raw WebAssembly.
2. Interacting with JavaScript
	- Building on your solid WebAssembly foundation, you’ll move on to using Rust to create your WebAssembly modules. You’ll start with the basics of creating a Rust version of your Checkers engine, and then you’ll move on to using [[Rust/code generation]], [[Rust/advanced tooling]], and [[Rust/macros]] to build powerful web applications that interact with JavaScript. By the end of this section, you’ll be able to write a multiuser, real-time chat application in Rust that compiles to WebAssembly.
1. Working with [[WASM/WASI|Non-Web Hosts]]
	- Once you’ve had your first taste of the power of WebAssembly, it’s time to take it to the next level and start working with non-web hosts. WebAssembly is about far more than just building things for the web, and you’ll see this firsthand as you create modules that control [[embedded/LED]] patterns for lights attached to a [[Raspberry Pi]] and, as your final project, you create a fully multiplayer arena battle game that lets developers pit their WebAssembly code against each other in a battle to the death.

Now it’s time to get coding!
