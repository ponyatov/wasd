# WASM/application

from [[Hoffman/Introduction]]:

I firmly believe that we stand on the precipice of another seismic change— [[WASM/WebAssembly]]. This new technology holds within it the potential to radically change how developers build applications for the web. Moreover, as you’ll see throughout this book, WebAssembly is more than just a new pebble thrown into the ocean of web technologies. It’s a tsunami that can change not only how consumers interact with and how developers build applications but also fundamentally alter the kinds of applications we can create. It may even transform our core definition of the word [[WASM/application]].
