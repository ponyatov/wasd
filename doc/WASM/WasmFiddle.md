# WasmFiddle

For WebAssembly, you’re going to jump into the ball pit by using an online tool called [[WASM/WebAssembly Studio]]. In December 2017, Mozilla started working on this project as a way to provide a low-friction introduction to WebAssembly. It’s a combination of some of their other WebAssembly tools like [[WASM/WasmFiddle]]. 2 This tool is entirely online and lets you create new projects in C, Rust, or AssemblyScript, a tool for compiling TypeScript to WebAssembly. It has gone through bursts of community activity and contribution since its creation.
