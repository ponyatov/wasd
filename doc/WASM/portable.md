First, and most importantly, WebAssembly is a **portable binary instruction format**. This is very similar to the original intent behind [[Java/bytecode]] and, if you’re familiar with the [[NET/Framework]], you may recognize this concept as implemented in [[NET/ILASM]], the low-level instruction set supporting the [[NET/CLR|Common Language Runtime]]. You’ll see this in depth in the next chapter, but for now it should suffice to know that the operations encoded in a WebAssembly module are not tightly coupled to any one hardware architecture or operating system, and these operations are just codes that a parser knows how to interpret.
